This file contains the script for Question 3 of Homework 1

This program includes a function drawCircles that does much of the work. The main program reads in an image, asks
the user for how many circles to draw, and then calls drawCircles to do the rest. The drawCircles function takes in
the image to draw on, and the number of circles. It draws that many circles, each between 10 and 50 pixels wide, and
with various random colors, each in a random location.
